# Design Patterns
 
## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns focus on handling object-creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for a given situation. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project, while these patterns aim to solve this problem by controlling the creation process.

Some patterns that fall under this category are Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton, and Builder.

## Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system need not change. They also assist in recasting parts of the system that donâ€™t fit a particular purpose into those that do.

Patterns that fall under this category include Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter, and Proxy.

## Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system. They identify common communication patterns among objects and provide solutions that distribute the responsibility of communication among different objects, thereby increasing communication flexibility. Essentially, behavioral patterns abstract actions from objects that take the action.

Some behavioral patterns include Iterator, Mediator, Observer, and Visitor.
